    <img class="" src="cybertech.png" </a>
    <h3 class="heading3">I graduated college recently and through my connections made in it, I got my first job in the
      tech field at Twitter by joining their cyber security team by successfully passing their technical interviews.
      Having this opportunity made me finally feel good about myself as I persevered through college to get to this
      point. However, it did not last long. I got discharged from employment though I was given severance pay. This made
      me doubt my abilities in tech as I began to face imposter syndrome.
      As I saw myself as a failure, I kept on thinking that because of this loss, I was not someone worthy of ever
      getting a job related to Cyber security or even anything in the tech industry at all. My mind consistently
      wondered about the “Why’s” of my discharge thinking if it had anything to do with me being a woman or not. I
      eventually fell into negative self-talk with myself where despite the education and personal growth I had when it
      came to tech, I did not feel like I belonged there anymore. Luckily for me, I had a great support system where my
      friends encouraged me to attend therapy. I wanted to regain my confidence where it did not matter to me about my
      gender, my accomplishments, or education, questioning if I belonged in a career field that I worked so hard
      towards.
      After 3 months or so of attending therapy, I was able to pull myself out of this dark pit. Imposter syndrome is
      something easy to fall into after experiencing a loss, especially as a woman in tech since so many are known to
      give up when it gets hard. However, I chose not to because I knew I endured those years at college majoring in
      Cyber security for a reason. I love working in the complex world of information security and learning to accept my
      failures taught me to never let imposter syndrome get the best of me because there are better opportunities out
      there despite the ones that made me feel like I was not enough.
