    <h1 class="heading1">Legal tech story</h1>
    <h2 class="heading2">T</h2>
    <h3 class="heading3">hroughout my life, I always struggled with choosing from wanting to pursue a career in the law or tech field. My
      parents always told me that becoming a lawyer or doctor is what I was supposed to do because anything tech related
      “is for men only” and not for women. I knew it was not true but immigrant parents were not easy to debate with.
      However, I eventually got into law because I found a passion in wanting to speak up for those who did not have
      power but, there was still a side to me whose eyes sparkled when I saw a girl on any TV show doing anything tech
      related. Held back by my parents' beliefs that as a woman, I would never succeed in the tech field and pursuing
      something related to the law was what was “right” for me, I wanted to prove them wrong for my future self and so,
      that is exactly what I did.
